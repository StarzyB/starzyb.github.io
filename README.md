This is nothing but a simple school project that I went *way* overboard for!
The entire website is coded from nothing but a blank document. All HTML, CSS, and Javascript code was written by me.

## Disclaimer!

If someone somehow finds this website (due to this being an open-source project), please note that every product and statement on this website is entirely fictional. It's a high school art project.
